GameDex is designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various genres of Video Games featured on different video game platforms, critics rated and user rated.

# Inspiration

I, like many others, have began playing Video Games more and more due to quarantine, and I have noticed that sometimes when I complete a Game, I am in a dilemma the next day of what to play next. Without an opinion your next game might end up as a waste of time and can lead to unwanted regret. I wanted to find a solution that would help people find the correct opinion based on Data Interpretation and offer suggestions for the next Game that would suit you.

# What it does

GameDex is a website that allows you to choose your next or first game carefully, and the website identifies different Genres and Platforms that you are play your games and provided with User and Critic scores (out of 10 and out of 100 respectively) for the game you are looking for. After looking for the game, users can proceed to an informational page for that game or the publisher's website for downloading and further assistance.

# How We built it

We built GameDex using the basic web development tools and customized the present dataset to identify and visualize different games based on their Genres and Platforms they can be played on. We incorporated the model in Netlify and created the website.

# Challenges We ran into

The initial problem was to categorize the games and then making the Website responsive was one of the few major upsets but we tackled it satisfactorily.

# Accomplishments that We're proud of

Developing a simple Idea into a real-time website and incorporating all of that within 24 hours.

# What's next for GameDex !

We hope that in the coming times we are able to incorporate ML models to provide users the perfect game from their expectations from the game, right on in our own website!
